ðŸ”— [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qOmZj7tuXD8oG1uDNAGgKsALt7whfRQIttRb_Z-MHD0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Datasets
From Kaggle: \
[Electric car sales (2010-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/electric-car-sales-2010-2024) \
[CO2 emissions by country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022)

## Initial research questions
Are Electric car sales correlated with reduced COâ‚‚ emisions per country? \
If so, is the correlation inversely proportional, are COâ‚‚ emisions reduced when electric car sales grow?

## Repo contents
### Jupyter Notebooks
Repo includes 5 notebooks:
- Initial Data Assesment.ipynb
